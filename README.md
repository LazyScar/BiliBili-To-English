## ⚡How it works

It starts by checking language-specific dictionary files to switch Chinese words to your selected language. If it finds a word/sentence not in the dictionary, it uses Google Translate for the translation. This whole process is quick, usually taking just 0.5 seconds to translate what's on your screen. Moreover, it can translate text even if you don't refresh the page.

## 🌐 Supported Languages
