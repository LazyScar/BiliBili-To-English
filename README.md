## How It Works

The extension uses a combination of **dictionary-based word matching** and **automatic translation engines**.

1. When a page loads, it checks a local dictionary for common Chinese terms.
2. If a term is not found, it uses the **Translation Engines** for dynamic translation.
3. Updates appear in real time.
